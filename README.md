# covid_19_stat

Code takes the data from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases (confirmed_global) and based on user input returns a graph of cumulative cases either for one country, several countries (with their names being entered via comma), top - N countries, all countries simultaneously, or for total worldwide cases.

Code doesn't handle errors properly at this point, so user should input the data correctly.

Required modules: Pandas, Matplotlib, numpy, urllib
